## Federated SVD
Singular value decomposition/Prinicpal Component Analysis is a versatile tool frequently used in biomedical workflows. For this application, we developed a fast and accurate federated singular value decomposition algorithm. Singular value decomposition returns two sets of mututally orthonormal vectors which can be used to approximate the data. One set of eigenvectors can be seen as a feature reprentation. The other set of vectors summarizes information about each sample. The sample singular vectors should not be shared due to potential privacy issues.
